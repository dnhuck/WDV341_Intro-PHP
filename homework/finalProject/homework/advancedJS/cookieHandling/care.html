	<h2> Routine Care, Diet, and Exercise</h2>
	 <ul>
      <li>Supervise your pet as you would a toddler. Keep doors closed, pick up after yourself, and block off rooms as necessary. This will keep her out of trouble and away from objects she shouldn’t put in her mouth.</li>
      <li>Brush her coat as needed, at least weekly.</li>
      <li>Clean their ears weekly, even as a puppy.</li>
      <li>Keep your dog’s diet consistent and don’t give them people food.</li>
      <li>Feed a high-quality diet appropriate for her age.</li>
      <li>Exercise your dog regularly, but don’t overdo it at first.</li>
    </ul>
