<h1>CSS Preprocessor</h1>
<ol>
<li>A CSS Preprocessor is responsible for allowing more a faster and more 
	flexible way to run css as an extension.</li>
<li>Some advantages of using scss would be that it saves time and larger
	projects can be split into modules making them easier to use or change
	if needed.</li>
<li>Some dissadvantages of scss would be the intial set up whicb does take
	some time to set up. Also, it is not the easiest to learn and not all
	computers or text editors provide sass so it must be installed.</li>
<li>Css preprocessors currently available: </li>
	<ul>
	<li>Sass</li>
	<li>Stylus</li>
