    <h1> Basics of Wind Energy </h1>
    <h2> Importance of Wind Energy </h2>
    <p>Wind energy (or wind power) refers to the process of creating electricity
      using the wind, or air flows that occur naturally in the earth’s
      atmosphere. <strong>Modern wind turbines are used to capture kinetic
        energy from the wind and generate electricity.</strong><br>
      There are three main types of wind energy: Utility-scale wind: Wind
      turbines that range in size from 100 kilowatts to several megawatts, where
      the electricity is delivered to the power grid and distributed to the end
      user by electric utilities or power system operators.<em>Distributed or
        "small" wind:</em> Single small wind turbines below 100 kilowatts that
      are used to directly power a home, farm or small business and are not
      connected to the grid. Offshore wind:<strong><em>Wind turbines that are
          erected in large bodies of water,</em></strong> usually on the
      continental shelf. Offshore wind turbines are larger than land-based
      turbines and can generate more power.<br>
      When the wind blows past a wind turbine, its blades capture the wind’s
      kinetic energy and rotate, turning it into mechanical energy. This
      rotation turns an internal shaft connected to a gearbox, which increases
      the speed of rotation by a factor of 100. That spins a generator that
      produces electricity. </p>
    <p>Wind Turbine Facts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The production of wind energy does not produce pollution. </li>
      <li>Wind turbines can be as tall as 200 meters and have blades that can
        move at a speed of up to 200 mph. </li>
      <li>Germany leads all countries in the amount wind energy that is produced
        per year. </li>
      <li>Albert Betz is a German physicist who discovered the
        theory of wind energy in 1919.</li>
