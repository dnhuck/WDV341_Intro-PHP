	 <h2>Alaskan Klee Kai</h2>
		<img src="images/klee_kai.jpg" alt="klee kai" height="400px;" class="img">
		<p> Alaskan Klee Kai is an extremely rare small breed dog that weighs between 10 and 24 pounds.  
	They were developed by Linda Spurlin in the 1970s to be a smaller version of the Alaskan Husky.  
	They were never meant to pull sleds but rather to be a companion dog, although they do have a striking resemblance to larger Spitz type dogs.  
	Their three sizes include a toy, miniature and standard and vary by height. </p>
	 <h2>Alaskan Malamute</h2>

		<p> While they may look the part of a wolf, the Alaskan Malamute is anything but wolf-like.  
	They may be strong, intelligent and independent with an athletic build, their real gift is that of being a companion and friend. 
	They were originally used to pull heavy sleds over long distances and used to help hunt seals and polar bears, but nowadays, 
	they may participate in a dog sport but they prefer to be by your side while you watch TV.
	They are considered to be one of the oldest and largest of the sled dogs. <p/>
	 <h2>Alaskan Husky</h2>

		<p> Alaskan Huskies are a group of dogs bred for their working ability and not necessarily for looks to conform to a particular breed standard. 
	They are known to be highly athletic, strong with an exceptional ability to run long distances.  
	They are generally not as large as Siberian Huskies or Malamutes but very muscular. 
	They are social, easy going and docile.  Generally friendly even with strangers, they are loyal and playful.  
	They are intelligent but independent and can appear to be stubborn.  They like to think for themselves so 
	they need to understand why they should obey a command. <p/>
	  <h2>American Eskimo</h2>
		<img src="images/eskimo.jpg" alt="american eskimo" height="400px"class="img"/>
		<p> Despite the name, this really is not an Alaskan dog Breed as many people think.  
	They were bred in Germany and were once called the White German Spitz. But due to anti-German biases during World War One, they were renamed, “American Eskimo Dog.”  
	American Eskimo Dogs come in three different sizes, the toy, miniature and the standard and look similar to the Japanese Spitz and the Samoyed.  
	They were originally bred to guard, but they are not an aggressive breed.  Being very vocal and territorial, they make great watch dogs and companions. <p/>
